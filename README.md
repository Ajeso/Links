Link



Links is a web-page containing the links to my sites.
A friend showed me the deisgn and I liked to the point I ended up re-creating it for myself.
This repo is purely made of  HTML and CSS. Creating it helped me improve my css skills the big lesson being on media queries.
I love it's sophosticated  simplicity 
I will be posting links to the my projects here. 


Please feel free to check them out.
